# gorp.yml -- Just a simple version identifier, so that the game can locate the gamedata folder and check that it's the correct version.
# There's no need to change this version if *new* data files are added, but it must be changed if the format of old files changes in such a way that older
# builds of the game can no longer read this data correctly at all.
