These optional settings for Visual Studio Code running on WSL on Windows will ensure that builds are cross-compiled for Windows, as well as adding editor
margins. This is largely just my own personal configuration, but I'm including it here for anyone else who wants to use it -- just copy this .vscode folder
to the root folder of the gorp repo.
